Project Two








# Technical Notes
Goal of the Project - Accurately predict stock prices using Machine Learning Models

Process
1. Track and predict future price movements of Tesla stock (TSLA). As well as competitors Ford (F), Lucid Group (LCID), General Motors (GM), and Toyota (TM)
2. Create machine learning code to help predict price. (Main Model will be LSTM)
3. Stretch goals - include creating an NLP program that will help us see how potential news articles can afffect stock price movements
4. Stretch goals - include using GRU, KNN, SVR,and RFR to predict stock price
5. Stretch goals - Creating Neural Networks and using Sentiment Analysis
6. Finalizing the project involves a summation of results of project, and answering the question of if it is possible to predict future stock price movements accurately
